      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">VetReady &middot; Effective: February 19, 2026 &middot; Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

      <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how VetReady ("the App") handles information. The short version: <strong>we do not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong></p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>VetReady does not collect any personal information. The App does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any identifying details.</p>
      <p>All data you enter into VetReady — including pet names, treatment records, and reminders — is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's on-device storage frameworks.</p>

      <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All data is stored locally on your device and, if you have iCloud enabled, synced to your personal iCloud account via Apple's CloudKit service. This sync is private and governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. Chartrand Apps has no access to your iCloud data.</p>
      <p>We do not operate any servers that receive, process, or store your data.</p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>VetReady does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking services. We do not use:</p>
      <p>Firebase, Google Analytics, Crashlytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Facebook SDK, or any similar service.</p>
      <p>The only third-party system involved is Apple's App Store (for purchases) and iCloud (for optional sync), both governed by Apple's own privacy policies.</p>

      <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>VetReady offers an optional one-time in-app purchase ("VetReady Pro") processed entirely by Apple's App Store. Chartrand Apps does not receive, store, or process any payment information. All purchase transactions are handled by Apple.</p>

      <h2>5. Push Notifications</h2>
      <p>VetReady may send local push notifications to remind you of upcoming pet treatments. These notifications are scheduled entirely on-device and do not involve any external servers or third parties. Notification preferences can be managed in your device's Settings.</p>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>VetReady does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The App does not collect any personal information from any users, including children.</p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

      <h2>8. Contact</h2>
